                <p>The purpose of this project was to analyse how weather changes as get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first
                   pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.
                   
                   After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. lattitude.  Factors we considered included:
                   temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity.  This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis,
                   as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.
